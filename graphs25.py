### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the study patterns of the students, several key insights can be drawn:

1. **Year of Admission (YOA) Analysis**: The data shows that students in their final year and during their internship phase tend to consume the highest number of video titles. This could be attributed to the increased focus on exam preparation and clinical exposure during these phases.

2. **Subject-wise Analysis**: The data indicates that certain subjects, such as Dermatology and Psychiatry, are more popular among students, as evidenced by the higher number of video titles consumed in these subjects.

3. **Time of Year Analysis**: There is a noticeable spike in video consumption during the months of April and August to November. This could be due to the timing of exams or the availability of new study materials during these periods.

4. **User Demographics**: The majority of users are doctors, which suggests that the platform is popular among medical professionals seeking to enhance their knowledge and skills.

5. **Study Duration**: The average time taken to complete a subject varies widely, ranging from a few days to several months. This could be due to differences in the complexity of the subject matter or the individual study habits of the students.

6. **Usage Patterns**: The data suggests that students tend to consume videos and solve QBank questions in a ratio of 1:4, indicating a preference for video-based learning followed by practice questions.

7. **Consistency**: Despite variations in study duration and subject popularity, there is a consistent pattern of usage among students, with heavy usage in the second half of the year and a consistent daily study duration of around 5 hours.

In conclusion, the study pattern analysis of the students reveals a consistent trend of heavy usage during specific periods of the year, a preference for certain subjects, and a balanced approach to learning through videos and QBanks.
